## 💡 Pro Tips

Don't overwhelm yourself! Begin with 3-4 manageable goals.

```
✅ Good: 3 focused goals
❌ Too Much: 15 goals you can't finish
```

### 2. **Be Specific**
Vague goals are hard to complete. Be clear!

```
✅ Good: "Practice 20 multiplication problems"
❌ Vague: "Study math"
```

### 3. **Estimate Time Realistically**
Think about how long things actually take.

```
✅ Realistic: "Read Chapter 3 - 30 minutes"
❌ Unrealistic: "Read whole book - 15 minutes"
```

### 4. **Use Priorities Wisely**
Not everything can be high priority!

```
✅ Balanced: 1 high, 2 medium, 1 low
❌ All High: Everything marked urgent
```

### 5. **Try AI Suggestions**
Let Tod AI help when you're not sure what to study.

## 💬 Example Conversations with AI

### About Goal Setting

**You:** "How should I set my daily goals?"

**Tod AI:** "Great question! Start with 3-4 specific goals. Make them clear like 'Practice 20 math problems' instead of just 'study math'. Set realistic times and mix different subjects. Try using the AI Suggest button to get started!"

### About Time Management

**You:** "I never finish my goals. What should I do?"

**Tod AI:** "Start smaller! If you're setting 10 goals and only finishing 3, try setting just 4 goals. It's better to complete a few goals fully than to leave many incomplete. Also, check if your time estimates are realistic. Track how long tasks actually take and adjust!"

### About Priorities

**You:** "When should I mark something as high priority?"

**Tod AI:** "High priority is for things you MUST do today. Think: test tomorrow, assignment due, important topic. Most goals should be medium priority (important but flexible). Save high priority for truly urgent items - usually 1-2 per day max!"
